# Fedora Post-Install Setup

Automated post-installation setup scripts for Fedora 42 Workstation and KDE Plasma.

This project includes two scripts tailored for distinct Fedora user needs:

- **`beginner-setup.sh`** â€” A universal beginner-friendly setup script that installs essential drivers, codecs, fonts, basic developer tools, and system utilities making Fedora ready-to-use for new Linux users.
- **`personal-setup.sh`** â€” A comprehensive personal development setup crafted for advanced users and developers, including IDEs, additional dev tools, productivity apps, custom themes, and more.

## What Each Script Installs and Configures

### Common features in both scripts:

- Updates and upgrades your entire Fedora system.
- Interactive GPU driver installation tailored for your hardware (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel).
- Installs **multimedia codecs** for smooth audio/video playback and DVD support.
- Configures programming fonts (e.g., FiraCode Nerd Font).

### Additional features in `personal-setup.sh` include:

## Important Notes

- **Secure Boot** must be disabled in BIOS/UEFI if installing proprietary NVIDIA drivers, or you must manually sign kernel modules for the driver to load.
- The scripts prompt interactively and require your confirmation before installing optional features.
- Log files for all script operations are saved in `~/fedora42-setup-logs/` for easy troubleshooting.
- A **restart is strongly recommended** after running the scripts to apply all driver and system changes properly.
- You should review scripts before execution if you want to make custom modifications.
